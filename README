Dependencies: 
The game linking with tak should also link with the following libraries:

Windows:
Devil - already in tak source tree
GLEW - already in tak source tree
SFML - already in tak source tree
Boost - Should be installed and configured under visual studio (boostpro installer or manually). You should then set the BOOST_PATH environment variable to your boost installation (eg: C:\Program Files (x86)\boost\boost_1_47 OR C:\boost\boost_1_49_0)
Bullet Physics

To manually install boost on windows:
Download boost, extract it to C:\boost
in the boost folder, in a terminal, run bootstrap, then .\b2
Set the BOOST_PATH environment variable


Linux gcc/mingw:
Boost
Devil
GLEW
SFML
Bullet Physics

On arch: pacman --needed -S make gcc premake glew bullet boost boost-libs sfml devil
