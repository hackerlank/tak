Steps to build the libs:

1. Download the source package from the bullet web site
2. Extract, build libraries (all non App_* projects) in debug AND release mode
3. Take the .lib in the lib folder, copy to external\vstudio2k10\bullet-2.80\lib
4. Take content of the src folder and copy to external\vstudio2k10\bullet-2.80\include
5. Remove all .cpp recursively from the include folder
6. Voila!
